# RoomOccupancy
To predict whether a room is occupied or not based on Environmental Factor
The objective of the project is to predict whether the room is occupied or not based on the
Environmental factors in that space for eg. Temperature,CO2, Humidity, Light etc. Clearly
the problem tell us that classification model has to be build so that it can predict the classes 
accurately with the help of Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM,KNN
Classifier, Random Forest, Ridge Classifier etc.
This is Standard Supervised Classification task. A classification problem where we have to
predict whether the room is occupied or not
